          <p>
            I'm an independent gameplay and tools engineering contractor,
            currently based inÂ Edinburgh, UK. I work with a wide variety of
            clients, from individuals looking for someone to build their dream
            game to independent studios and startups that need a talented
            professional to help to develop their projects. I graduated from
            Mackenzie: Industrial Design, and have commercial AAA programming
            experience working as an Online Tools Designer at Segment. As an
            independent contractor, I take a lot of joy in being able to
            continually work on a variety of different projects as it forces me
            to interact with new technologies, work with new people and
            consistently allow me to keep growing and learning...
